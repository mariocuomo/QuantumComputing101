# Measure and Collapse of the Wavefunction

The first experiments with qubits focused on understanding how to measure their quantum states. Measurement in quantum mechanics is a unique process because it causes the qubit to collapse from a superposition of states into one of the basis states.

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|1\rangle
$$

In [intro](https://github.com/mariocuomo/QuantumComputing101/edit/main/intro/README.md) to Quantum Computing, we described that a **balanced superposition** for a single qubit is a quantum state where the qubit has equal probabilities of being measured in either of its basis states.

Let's experiment with _IBM Quantum Learning_.
