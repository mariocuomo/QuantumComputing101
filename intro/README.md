# Quantum Computing introduction

**Quantum computing** is an advanced field of computer science that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers.

Quantum computing differs from classical computing in several fundamental ways:

1. **Basic Units of Information**
    - **Classical Computing**: Uses bits as the basic unit of information, which can be either 0 or 1.
    - **Quantum Computing**: Uses qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously due to the principle of superposition1.
    
2. **Superposition**
    - **Classical Computing**: Bits exist in a definite state (either 0 or 1).
    - **Quantum Computing**: Qubits can exist in multiple states at once, allowing quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously.
    
3. **Entanglement**
    - **Classical Computing**: Bits operate independently.
    - **Quantum Computing**: Qubits can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This property can be used to perform complex computations more efficiently.

4. **Interference**
     - **Classical Computing**: Does not utilize interference.
     - Quantum Computing: Uses quantum interference to amplify correct answers and cancel out incorrect ones, improving the probability of arriving at the correct solution.

5. **Processing Power**
     - **Classical Computing**: Processes information in a linear, step-by-step manner.
     - **Quantum Computing**: Can solve certain problems much faster by exploring many possible solutions simultaneously, making it particularly powerful for tasks like cryptography, optimization, and simulating molecular structures.
